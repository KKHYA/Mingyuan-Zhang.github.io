I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate in the SMILE Lab at Northeastern University, advised by Prof. Yun Raymond Fu. I received my M.S. degree from Northeastern University and B.S. degree from Xidian University in Computer Engineering and Telecommunication Engineering, respectively.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Computer Vision, Sparse Network, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Multimodal Learning**. I am passionate about building scalable and interpretable AI systems, and I am always open to collaboration.
